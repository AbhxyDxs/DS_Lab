Cycle 1
1.Write  a  NumPy  program  to  create  an  element-wise  comparison
	(greater,  greater_equal,  less and less_equal) of two given arrays.
2.Write a NumPyprogram to create an array of all the even integers from 30 to 70.
3.Write a NumPy program to create a 3x3 identity matrix.
4.Write  a  NumPy  program  to  create  a  vector  with  values from  0  to  20 
	and  change  the  sign  of the numbers in the range from 9 to 15.
5.Write  a  NumPy  program  to  create  a  5x5  zero  matrix  
	with  elements  on  the  main  diagonal equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
6.Write  a  NumPy  program  to  compute  sum  of  all  elements,  
	sum  of  each  column  and  sum  of each row of a given array.
7.Write a NumPy program to save a given array to a text file and load it.
8.Write a NumPy program to check whether two arrays are equal (element wise) or not.
9.Write  a  NumPy  program  to  create  a  4x4  array  with  random  values,  
	now  create  a  new  array from the said array swapping first and last rows.
10.Write a NumPy program to multiply two given arrays of same size element-by-element.
